# Task: 

1. Comment on the issue to say you can pick this up. An OLS team member will assign it to you, but you can begin work immediately without waiting for the github assignment. 
2. Please review the transcript in question, and keep an eye open for anything that could reveal WHO the transcript participant actually is. Don't comment here - instead please speak to an OLS team member to ask them to redact it.
